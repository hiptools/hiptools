Hiptools is a suite of instruments helping to work with Orthodox Church service texts (Greek and Slavonic).
Currently there is a library of texts in HIP standart (Slavonic) and Unicode (Greek), an index tool and a search tool.
The library was created on the basis of archives, available on www.orthlib.ru and http://glt.xyz

There is no binary executable for MS Windows. Still it is possible to find instructions, PyGTK (+ glib) and python installations 
on the web to try and run the scripts on Win.
